# libft

The goal of the project is to build a library with ~80 functions (some of them inspired by the libc).

## Installing

Clone the repository and: 

```
make
```

## Linux Support

In the Makefile, simply replace :

```
FLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra
```

With :

```
#FLAGS = -Wall -Wno-empty-body -Wno-unused -Wextra
```

## Disclaimer

This project, along with most projects from my github, follows the rules specified by the [42 Norm](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6bpolsav238d97/norme.en.pdf?dl=0). Among others, it implies that all functions do not exceed 25 lines, as means to make the code as clear as possible.
