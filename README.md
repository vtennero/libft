# libft

The goal of the project is to build a library with ~80 functions (some of them inspired by the libc).

## Installing

Clone the repository and: 

```
make
```

## Linux Support

To use it on Linux:

In the Makefile, simply replace :

```
FLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra
```

With :

```
#FLAGS = -Wall -Wno-empty-body -Wno-unused -Wextra
```
